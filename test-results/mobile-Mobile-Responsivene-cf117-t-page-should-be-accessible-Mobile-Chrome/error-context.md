      - generic [ref=e15]: AI is evolving faster than anyone can keep up—except students
      - paragraph [ref=e16]: We're living through a unique window in history. AI tools are dropping every week. Use cases are being discovered in real-time. Traditional education can't move fast enough. Experts are still catching up.
      - paragraph [ref=e17]: But students? We're already in the trenches—experimenting, breaking things, finding what works. We're building our careers while these tools are being built. That makes us uniquely positioned to master them.
    - generic [ref=e19]:
      - generic [ref=e20]: our mission
      - generic [ref=e21]: Spread the sauce. No gatekeeping.
      - paragraph [ref=e22]: We believe AI knowledge should flow freely between students. If you figure out a killer workflow, a game-changing prompt technique, or a creative application—share it. Teach it. Build on what others discover. That's how we all stay on the forefront together.
